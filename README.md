# 🧠 AskAtlas — Internal Knowledge Q&A Assistant

AskAtlas is an internal knowledge retrieval assistant that leverages semantic search and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to help team members query institutional knowledge scattered across platforms like Slack, Notion, Google Docs, and Emails. It enables fast, intelligent, domain-aware Q&A over your company’s data.

---

## 📘 Overview

AskAtlas ingests documents from internal sources, preprocesses and chunks them into semantically meaningful units, embeds these chunks into a vector space for similarity search, and uses a large language model (LLM) to generate accurate, context-aware answers based on the retrieved information.

## 🏗️ Key Modules

### 1. **Data Ingestion**
- Sources: Slack, Notion, Google Docs, Emails
- Normalizes content to a common format:
```json
{
  "source": "Slack",
  "content": "This is a message",
  "metadata": {
    "author": "John Doe",
    "timestamp": "2023-05-01",
    "channel": "#product"
  }
}
```

### 2. **Preprocessing & Chunking**
- Cleans and chunks documents
- Retains metadata for filtering and context

### 3. **Embedding & Vector Store**
- Embedding Models: OpenAI or SentenceTransformers
- Vector DB: FAISS, Weaviate, or Pinecone

### 4. **Retriever**
- Performs semantic search using cosine similarity
- Optional: hybrid keyword + vector retrieval

### 5. **Q&A Generator (RAG)**
- Prompts an LLM with context from retrieved chunks and a user query
- Example Prompt:
```
Using the context below, answer the question as accurately as possible. 
If the answer is not in the context, say “Not found.”

Context:
[retrieved content]

Question:
[user's question]
```

### 6. **Interface Layer**
- CLI, Streamlit, or Gradio UI
- Optional: Slackbot

### 7. **Feedback Loop**
- Logs queries, answers, and feedback (👍👎)
- Used for continuous improvement

### 8. **Analytics (Optional)**
- Tracks common queries, content gaps, and usage patterns

### 9. **Access Control (Optional)**
- Metadata filtering or role-based access for sensitive content

## 📦 Document Chunk Schema
```json
{
  "id": "doc_123",
  "content": "This is a paragraph or chunk of text.",
  "metadata": {
    "source": "Notion",
    "document_title": "Onboarding Guide",
    "author": "Jane Smith",
    "date": "2023-04-10",
    "path": "/notion/onboarding.md"
  }
}
```
